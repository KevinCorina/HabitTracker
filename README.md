# HabitTracker

This repo contains some of the source code for my current project, a minimalist habit tracker. It's another attempt to get more hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services like Amplify, AppSync, Cognito, and DynamoDB. I'm also using it to learn more about common web technologies like Node.js, React.js, and GraphQL. Though it's still a work in progress, all of the major features are implemented.

The site is hosted here for the time being.:
